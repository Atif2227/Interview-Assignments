Data Analyst Technical Test Instructions

Please complete this technical test within 4 days of receiving it.
Please spend no more than 4 hours on it.
Once complete please return a Jupyter Notebook (in both .pynb and .pdf format) via LinkedIn.

You are requested to provide an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two tables (trades and users)
located in a Postgres database. The trades table contains trades placed by users. The user table
contains user attributes. You should demonstrate your SQL knowledge by writing several queries
to explore this data including joins, window functions, CTEs. You should also demonstrate your
Python3 knowledge by cleaning the data, engineering novel features and visualising interesting
findings. Please do not only use SQL or Python3 for this task, you must show your capabilities
across both technologies.

Data Catalog
login_hash - hashed user login ID
ticket_hash - hashed trade ID
server_hash - hashed machine ID (note that logins and tickets belong to servers)
symbol - financial instrument being traded
digits - number of significant digits after the decimal place
cmd - 0 = buy, 1 = sell
volume - size of the trade
open_time - open time of the trade
open_price - open time of the trade
close_time - close time of the trade (epoch means trade is still open)
contractsize - size of a single contract of the financial instrument
country_hash - hash of the country of the user
currency - denomination of the account currency
enable - if the login account is enabled or not

Your EDA should demonstrate your skill set, it should highlight novel findings about the data
and it will show your ability to analyse and tell stories with data. Please pay attention to
code quality and make sure you identify any issues with the data.
